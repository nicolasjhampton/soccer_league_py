Dear Clara Tanner,

I regret to inform you that Jill Tanner will be playing with
the raptors this year. They really didn't seem like they 
wanted to be at tryouts in the first place. God knows I
didn't. Are you sure Jill Tanner is the "sports type"? One too
many Tolken books if you ask me.Anyway, the raptors ain't
winning any Heisman's this year, I'm sure Jill Tanner can sit 
bench and carry balls with the best of them. You should be 
so proud blah blah blah...just remember to pick the weasel
up on time, 'aight?

Coach Biff
