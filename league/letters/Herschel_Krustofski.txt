Dear Hyman and Rachel Krustofski,

I regret to inform you that Herschel Krustofski will be playing with
the dragons this year. They really didn't seem like they 
wanted to be at tryouts in the first place. God knows I
didn't. Are you sure Herschel Krustofski is the "sports type"? One too
many Tolken books if you ask me.Anyway, the dragons ain't
winning any Heisman's this year, I'm sure Herschel Krustofski can sit 
bench and carry balls with the best of them. You should be 
so proud blah blah blah...just remember to pick the weasel
up on time, 'aight?

Coach Biff

First practice is a week from now, 2017-04-16 at 4pm
