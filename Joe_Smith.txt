Dear Jim and Jan Smith,

I regret to inform you that Joe Smith will be playing with
the dragons this year. They really didn't seem like they 
wanted to be at tryouts in the first place. God knows I
didn't. Are you sure Joe Smith is the "sports type"? One too
many Tolken books if you ask me.Anyway, the dragons ain't
winning any Heisman's this year, I'm sure Joe Smith can sit 
bench and carry balls with the best of them. You should be 
so proud blah blah blah...just remember to pick the weasel
up on time, 'aight?
