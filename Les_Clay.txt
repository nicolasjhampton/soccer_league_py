Dear Wynonna Brown,

I regret to inform you that Les Clay will be playing with
the sharks this year. They really didn't seem like they 
wanted to be at tryouts in the first place. God knows I
didn't. Are you sure Les Clay is the "sports type"? One too
many Tolken books if you ask me.Anyway, the sharks ain't
winning any Heisman's this year, I'm sure Les Clay can sit 
bench and carry balls with the best of them. You should be 
so proud blah blah blah...just remember to pick the weasel
up on time, 'aight?
